# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System

This project is part of my Data Science & Machine Learning Internship at **DSPL Technologies**. The goal is to predict student performance based on various features such as attendance, study hours, previous grades, and more, using supervised machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Educational institutions are constantly striving to identify students who need support early. By predicting student performance using machine learning, we can assist teachers and administrators in making data-driven interventions to improve academic outcomes.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle – Student Performance Predictions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/haseebindata/student-performance-predictions)
- Features:
  - `StudentID`
  - `Name`
  - `Gender`
  - `AttendanceRate`
  - `StudyHoursPerWeek`
  - `PreviousGrade`
  - `ExtracurricularActivities`
  - `ParentalSupport`
  - `FinalGrade` (used to derive `Performance` class: **High**, **Medium**)

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked for missing values, data types, and distributions
- Visualized distributions of grades, attendance, and study hours
- Correlation analysis to find key influencing features

---

## 🧪 Preprocessing

- Dropped irrelevant columns (`Name`, `StudentID`)
- Encoded categorical variables (`Gender`, `ExtracurricularActivities`, `ParentalSupport`)
- Mapped final grades to performance categories:
  - `High`: FinalGrade ≥ 75
  - `Medium`: 50 ≤ FinalGrade < 75
  - `Low`: FinalGrade < 50 (not present in this dataset)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Two classification models were trained and evaluated:

| Model                | Accuracy |
|---------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 100%     |
| Random Forest       | 100%     |

📌 *Note: Due to small and imbalanced dataset, accuracy appears perfect. Real-world results may vary with larger datasets.*

## 🧠 Feature Importance (Random Forest)

Top features influencing performance:
1. `PreviousGrade`
2. `StudyHoursPerWeek`
3. `AttendanceRate`

## 💾 Model Deployment

- Best model saved using `joblib`:
  ```python
  joblib.dump(model, 'student_performance_model.pkl')

🚀 Future Work
Handle class imbalance for better generalization

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit

Incorporate more data (e.g., behavior, class participation)
